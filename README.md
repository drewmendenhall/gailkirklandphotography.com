[gailkirklandphotography.com](Gail Kirkland Photography) is the photo portfolio web site for, you guessed it, [Gail Kirkland Photography][].

The site's minimalistic design brings focus to some of Gail Kirkland Photography's best photos. It features interactive photo galleries. Gallery photos fill as much screen real estate as possible, while maintaining aspect ratio and without cropping.

The app is optimized for all screen sizes. The logo is in SVG, so it appears crisp at all sizes and pixel densities.

Each page is fully-rendered on the server. Subsequent interaction and page navigation is handled client-side, thanks to `react` and `react-router`.

The top navigation bar has pure-CSS dropdowns which group navigation to related pages.

The app does not require that the client run Javascript. Running Javascript enables gallery picture transitions and quicker navigation (no full-page reloads). Also, opening one dropdown will close the others.
