Run the `dev` task to start a development server. Hot reloading is enabled, so changes to React components and styles will be near-immediately visible in the browser, while state (e.g. open dropdowns) is retained.
```
npm run dev
```
Run the `prod` task to start a server that operates in production mode. Production-ready files will be placed in `public/` and hot reloading will be not be enabled.
```
npm run prod
```
